This file is for "com" scoped components. The com here is not short for "component" but rather for the ".com" portion of a domain name.

It is common practice make packages based on controlled domain names to guarantee uniqueness.

So, for example someone owning the domain name "example.com" might therefore make a "com.example" package. The order of package components being the reverse of the order of the domain name sections as folders move from general to specific whereas parts of a domain name move from specific to general.

The result of this would be a folder structure of "com/example/". As such, this folder may have several other folders within it.

Similar folders for "org" and "net" would follow the same pattern.
